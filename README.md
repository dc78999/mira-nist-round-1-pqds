This is a modified version of the orignal MIRA submission in response to NIST's call for proposal for standar-
dization of quantum-resistant digital signature schemes. The original README.md is archived as README.md.old in the same root directory. This renewed README.md is written to help interested developers can run and test this version on their own environment.

## Introduction

This version is a migration of MIRA to make it runnable on ARM-A53 processor. It also laid a ground work for future optimization.


## Getting started

### Prepare the environment

#### Hardware

This version of MIRA is tested on Raspberry PI 2W with ARM-A53 processor

#### Software dependencies

##### aarch64-gnu-gcc

##### openssl

##### keccak/XKCP library

##### PAPI


### Initial idea

### Benchmarking

### Future work
